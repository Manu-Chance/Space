# Space
# This Repository is to help with watching Celestial Objects in the sky.
# So far it doesn't do anything, but I'm planning on making it keep you up to date on the weather
# conditions, and later include the position of objects using celestial coordinates.
# Much later the plan is to add graphical elements and much much later create a graphical
# trajectory calculator that shows the path of a spaceship using the velocity of the ship,
# as well as the gravitational pull of objects.
